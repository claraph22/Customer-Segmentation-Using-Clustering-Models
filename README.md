## Description

This portfolio project involves developing and applying clustering models to perform customer segmentation using credit card data. The segmentation process aims to group customers into distinct categories based on their spending patterns, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

This project showcases my ability to:
- Handle real-world datasets and perform comprehensive data preprocessing.
- Utilize advanced machine learning techniques such as clustering for segmentation tasks.
- Interpret model results and translate them into actionable business insights.

## Requirements

To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To explore and run the project:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `P1G6_Set_1_Clara.ipynb`.
2. Execute the cells in order, starting with data loading and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
3. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to understand each step of the process.

## Visualizations

This project includes several visualizations that help to better understand the data and the results of the clustering models. These visualizations include:

- **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis.
- **Elbow plots** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Cluster distribution plots** to visualize how customers are grouped.
- **Scatter plots** to explore the relationships between different customer segments.

## Results

The key findings from the customer segmentation include:

- **Identified distinct customer segments**: Based on spending behavior, which can be used for targeted marketing.
- **Business insights**: Provided actionable insights that can help in designing personalized offers and improving customer engagement.

The clustering models effectively grouped customers into meaningful segments, which can be leveraged to enhance business strategies.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of clustering techniques in customer segmentation. By analyzing credit card data, I was able to uncover meaningful patterns and group customers into distinct segments. These insights can significantly impact marketing strategies and customer relationship management, leading to better business outcomes.
